This repository is exclusive for the portofolio website which I've created using HTML and CSS knowledge that I have acquired through self-learning. The intention is just to have some visualization, instead of just going to a github repository. 

To access the webiste please follow => 

Soon it will be updated by displaying some charts and graphs, line of codes on the website as well to give more visualization towards the work that has being done.

Hope you enjoy, 
Thank you!
